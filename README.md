## Tasks

For this project I was given no started code. I did a little bit of html and css, but the vast majority of the work was done in javascript. This project was definitely a challenge. There were a lot of moving parts to manage, and a lot of changing variables.

## What I Learned

One of the biggest things I learned with this project was how much the difficulty of a project can scale depending on size. Writing a few functions and getting everything to work is pretty easy. But when you have a lot of functions and data moving around, it can be incredibly easy to get lost or overwhelmed. One thing that really helped me was to draw the process out on a notebook.
